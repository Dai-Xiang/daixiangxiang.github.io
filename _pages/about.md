I am a Ph.D. student in [Advanced Networking and System Research Laboratory](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) (ANSRLab), supervised by Chair Professor [John C.S. Lui](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/)  (ACM/IEEE Fellow, Fellow of HKAES) at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) (CUHK). Before that, I obtained my **honor bachelor** degree (**Advanced Class, GPA: 3.95/4.0**) from the [Department of Electronics and Information Engineering](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) (HUST). 



# Research

I am passionate about data-driven online sequential decision-making under uncertainty, such as reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms, which enhance decision-making through continuous learning from new data and strategy adjustments. My focus also includes developing and refining online learning algorithms for diverse applications such as web recommendation systems, multimedia platforms, computer networks, and large language models. I aim to create efficient, scalable solutions with provable learning efficiency and strong generalizability guarantees in these areas. I welcome opportunities for collaboration—please feel free to contact me (E-mail: xiangxdai0@gmail.com).
